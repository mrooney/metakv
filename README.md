metakv
======

metakv is a key-value store which stores data in metakv. This both lacks meaning and accurately describes its implementation.

metakv is not ACID-compliant; particularly, the durability of any data stored in metakv is undefined.

metakv is a work-in-progress, and this README will shortly contain code and usage information.
